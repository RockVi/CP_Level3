        <h2>A bit of me</h2>
        <p>I had a keen interest in art expressions, culture, and knowledges that I had always wanted to explore further. I knew I needed to find a way to incorporate my interests into my career. So, I decided to learn web development as a way to express them, and also to incorporate maths and logic to my routines.</p>
        <p>It was a challenging transition, but I found that web development allowed me to be creative in new ways. I could build something from scratch and experiment with different designs, layouts, and functionality.</p>
        <p>My career has taken on a new dimension since I started exploring my other interests. I feel like I'm constantly learning, and I'm excited to see where this path will take me.</p>
